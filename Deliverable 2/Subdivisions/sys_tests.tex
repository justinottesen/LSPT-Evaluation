\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sample DataSets}

Our datasets will mainly consist of dummy data that is formatted to match what real data would look like. As we start to receive real data we will phase out the dummy data. We will have 5 different datasets to pull from in order to properly test our component.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The First Dataset is the simplest, a list of unique unsigned integers. They will serve as unavailable Query IDs, so that we can test our ID generator. 
    \item The Second Dataset is a text file filled with simulated feedback jsons. Every json will have a valid category (bug, suggestion, etc.) and will server to test our Feedback reporting function.
    \item The Third Dataset is a set of simulated metrics from every component that will serve to test both our metric repoting and admin view.
    \item The Fourth Dataset is made up of simulated user queries and results in list of jsons. They will be used to test interaction reporting and will partially fill our Search Data Store. 
    \item The Final Dataset is the largest since it will be used to test multiple component functions. A text file containing many simulated sets of queries, IDs, results, clicked results, ignored results, and timestamps. This DataSet, along with the Fourth, will server to test Autofill, query data fetching and Admin View.
  \end{itemize}
All of the above DataSets will follow the format laid out by \textbf{Architectural Divisions}.
