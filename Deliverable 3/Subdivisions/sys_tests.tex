\subsection*{Sample DataSets}

Although we did not use any datasets, we did create sample data that we would 
likely receive from UI/UX, as well as tested example metrics that would be 
received from all other components. 

\subsection*{Drivers/Stubs}

Our component used multiple stubs to simulate interactions with other 
components.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{UI/UX Stub:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This stub simulated interactions with the UI/UX component. The
        stub called the endpoint \texttt{getQueryID} to simulate the UI/UX 
        component starting the query. In addition, the stub would send query 
        information, simulating once the user clicks on a specific link.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metrics Stub:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This stub simulated interactions with all other components. The
        stub called the endpoint \texttt{reportMetrics} to simulate all 
        components submitting their metrics. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Link Analysis Stub:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This stub simulated interactions with Link Analysis. This stub is 
        to ensure that the query results that we send to Link Analysis is 
        successfully sent and able to be read by the Link Analysis component.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
